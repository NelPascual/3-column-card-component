## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

Among the things I was able to learn and practice in this project are:

- Use of CSS Grid for positioning columns according to the screen on which they are displayed.

- Use of hover state in buttons, and use of flex properties for positioning elements in the viewport.

Here are some examples:

```html
<body>
  <main class="card-container">
  </main>
</body>
```
```css
body {
    display: flex;
    flex-direction: column;
    height: 100%;
    min-height: 100vh;
}

.card-container {
    flex: 1;
    border-radius: 1rem;
    padding: 2.4rem;
}
```

### Continued development

I continue to practice, this is already my seventh challenge completed, and I always find something that makes it difficult for me to finish the work quickly, so I look for help on google and sometimes I use ChatGPT.

## Acknowledgments

I thank Frontend Mentor for providing free resources to put into practice what I have learned, and above all a place to show them.
